## Grounds

# Grounds — I81 `agent-loading-forensics` (live-run successor plan ENTRY 6, the LAST entry)

Plan: `notes/plan-20261018T1745Z-live-run-successor.md` ENTRY 6 (verbatim above in
the plan doc; owner-signed). Repo tip: `repos/tart` @ `project/pi-port` `7b70e8a`
(the I80 merge; I77–I80 verdicts CONTINUE). This entry closes the plan — entries
1–6 complete after it.

## The three defects, root-caused at the current tip

**(a) Unknown tools in a custom agent's `tools` frontmatter REJECT the whole file.**
`tart`'s profile contract (`repos/tart/lib/tart/schemas/subagents.rb:92-104`,
`rule(:tools)`) fails the contract on any name outside `ProfileFields::TOOLS_UNIVERSE`
(`read edit write bash find grep ls contact_supervisor`, :29-31);
`Profiles.build_profile` (`lib/tart/subagents/profiles.rb:139-152`) maps contract
failure to warn+SKIP — the agent never loads. Live proof (the 07:40Z devstral
session, `~/.tart/sessions/--Users-eric-architect-spaces-20261018-devstral-docs--/2026-10-18T07-40-42-220Z_01a14df4-a96c-7070-a1ee-21512a279518.jsonl`):
the coordinator playbook (`tools: subagent, bg_wait, read, grep, find, ls, bash`)
and the builder playbook (`web_search`, `fetch_content`, `get_search_content`)
were both invisible at spawn — the only surface was
`{"error":"unknown agent \"architect-coordinator\". Available agents: …"}`; the
file-rejection diagnostic itself is DARK today (`Profiles.resolve` → `resolve_table`
discards `discover`'s diagnostics; no boot surface renders them — contrast
`bin/tart:556-559`, which DOES render skills + prompts diagnostics as
`command_line` rows). After stripping `bg_wait` the coordinator was STILL rejected —
**(b)** is the remaining blocker.

pi's behavior (the parity bar): pi-subagents 0.79.1 NEVER validates tool NAMES at
load — `agents.js:739-741` throws only on a structurally invalid `tools` value
(non-array/non-strings); unknown names flow to the child and pi's loadout filter
drops them (`repos/pi/packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts:1575-1582`,
`_applyToolLoadout` — `flatMap` over the registry, unknown names simply absent).
So pi hosts the coordinator playbook verbatim; tart cannot. The plan's law:
warn-and-drop — load the agent, drop only the unknown entries, warn.

**(b) `subagent` is not grantable to custom agents — the coordinator role is
unhostable.** Three stacked barriers at the tip:
1. `TOOLS_UNIVERSE` (schemas/subagents.rb:29-31) omits `subagent` → any profile
   declaring it is rejected (defect (a)'s mechanism).
2. Even if the profile loaded, `Tools::Registry.build`
   (`lib/tart/tools/registry.rb:66-69`) raises `ArgumentError, "Unknown tool:
   subagent"` — `TOOL_CLASSES` has no entry — so the child argv
   `--tools subagent,…` (`manager.rb:395-399`, `spawn_argv_and_env`) would die at
   the child's boot (`print.rb:90` builds the loadout from exactly the
   `--tools` list).
3. Nothing bounds recursion: there is no depth marker anywhere in the child env
   (the I48 closed pick list, `manager.rb:430-505`, carries no depth).

Process-level nesting ALREADY works at the tip: a gate-on print child registers
its own Manager (`bin/tart:306-310`) and the hooks registered-tools merge
(`registry.rb:80-86`) appends `subagent` to the child's wire loadout REGARDLESS of
the `--tools` list — the I49-recorded residual "children-of-gate-on-parents declare
`subagent` on their wire". What is missing is the AUTHORING path: no agent can be
DECLARED with the tool. pi's grant law (pi-subagents 0.79.1
`src/runs/shared/child-tool-plan.js:200-204`): fanout is authorized when the
effective tools allowlist includes `subagent` OR `allowNestedSubagents: true` (the
playbooks carry BOTH — `tools:` lists `subagent` explicitly, so the tools-list
grant covers the live case; `allowNestedSubagents` stays tolerated-and-ignored in
the port, a declared residual). pi's recursion bound: `DEFAULT_SUBAGENT_MAX_DEPTH
= 2` (`src/shared/types.js:134`), operator override via `PI_SUBAGENT_MAX_DEPTH`
(`types.js:178-183`), children inherit (`resolveChildMaxSubagentDepth`,
`types.js:184-187`; `resolveChildDepth` = parent depth + 1, `types.js:196-201`),
blocked when `depth >= maxDepth` (`checkSubagentDepth`, `types.js:188-195`). The
blocked-spawn bytes, pi verbatim
(`src/runs/foreground/subagent-executor.js:6983-6993`):
`Nested subagent call blocked (depth=<d>, max=<m>). You are running at the maximum
subagent nesting depth. Complete your current task directly without delegating to
further subagents.`

**(c) Forensics blindness.** Live specimen
`~/.tart/subagents/01a14df7-f99a-7244-a23e-e172ebd97383/` (the 07:44Z devstral
worker run): status.json carries `"task": null, "taskChars": 3140` (the I48
taskChars-only redaction, `manager.rb:1153`), and the transcript sits at
`…/sessions/sessions/--Users-eric-architect-spaces-20261018-devstral-docs--/2026-10-18T07-44-19-606Z_….jsonl`
— a DOUBLED `sessions/` segment. Mechanism: the child argv passes
`--session-root <run-dir>/sessions` (`manager.rb:398`) but the Recorder composes
`File.join(root, "sessions", safe_path)` (`lib/tart/agent/session.rb:78-80`) —
root already IS the sessions dir, so the path doubles. `status.sessionRoot`
(`manager.rb:1160`) points at `<dir>/sessions` — today the PARENT of the real
(doubled) dir. The manager's transcript glob (`manager.rb:1225`,
`sessions/**/*.jsonl`) matches both layouts, so adoption of historical doubled
dirs keeps working under a cure.

Task-text ruling (the plan offers text or digest): pi redacts prompt text from
EVENTS and status step descriptions (`chain-append.js:140-146` `PROMPT_REDACTED`;
`async-execution.js:1511`) — but the RUNNER's own launch artifacts carry the task
text (`async-execution.js:1254` `task: params.task`, `:1910` `task: taskText`).
The port's `status.json` is the run's own artifact (the runner-artifact analog),
and the plan's forensics bar — "a post-mortem can answer what was this run asked
to do from disk" — must hold even when the child died before recording a
transcript (the dead-run specimen class, I78). DECISION: carry the RAW task text
verbatim in `status.task` (fork preamble excluded — it is harness boilerplate,
recorded in full in the transcript); `taskChars` stays the raw char count; the
I79 box NEVER renders a task row (`render/subagent_box.rb:27-28`, pi's redaction
law) — unchanged.

## Standing context the spec rides on

- I48 subagents core (the closed child env — OQ-7 law; the sanctioned-key pin at
  `test/subagents_test.rb:292-320`), I49 profiles+intercom (the contract, the
  bridge union, the registered-tools merge order), I70 subagents default-ON (the
  child's gate resolves ON from the settings default — the stale "children never
  nest" argv comment predates the flip), I78 runner health, I79 status box, I80
  child encoding (the locale law; the sanctioned list now carries
  `LANG LC_ALL LC_CTYPE`).
- BRIEF §8 exact-parity bar: pi in one tab, tart in another, indistinguishable —
  the parity target for subagents behavior is the INSTALLED pi-subagents
  0.79.1 (`~/.pi/agent/npm/node_modules/pi-subagents/`) + the pinned pi clone
  `repos/pi` (the rig oracle at tag v1.1.0 for the render battery; subagents
  seams cite the installed module, the I49/I80 precedent).
- Verification gate floor (tart): full suite + `SEAM_BENCH_OK` + the carried
  88-gate battery (rebased this spec to 92: 87 carried + scope rewritten + 4 new).
- Constraints (plan ENTRY 6): NO rig scenario-content edits; the I70 MOTD
  prompt-scope package tier law untouched; `.pi/` stays agents-only.

## Facts measured this session (controls actually run)

- Base suite floor at `7b70e8a`, cold: `bundle install --quiet && bundle exec rake`
  → **1453 runs / 6846 assertions / 0F / 0E / 1S, exit 0**;
  `bundle exec ruby bench/seam_bench.rb` → `SEAM_BENCH_OK`.
- Remote ancestry: `git -C repos/tart merge-base --is-ancestor 7b70e8a origin/main`
  → **exit 1 (NOT an ancestor)** — `origin/main` holds squashed PR merges;
  provision needs `--base 7b70e8a` (re-verify immediately before provisioning).
- Base test counts (gate floors): `test/subagents_profiles_test.rb` 15,
  `test/subagents_test.rb` 34, `test/subagents_e2e_test.rb` 11 (all GREEN at
  base); the discriminator filters `/dropped/`, `/nested|depth_cap/`,
  `/forensic/`, `/nested/` (e2e) are EMPTY at base — the four new gates are
  declared-RED there (verified by name-grep over the three files: zero matches).
- The carried-pin audit (the I80 lesson, run BEFORE freeze): the I81 laws
  contradict exactly FIVE carried pins, ALL in the frozen touch set as DECLARED
  re-pins — `subagents_profiles_test.rb:129-134` (the unknown-tool reject
  message), `subagents_test.rb:257` (task never recorded), `:290` (the
  session-root argv value), `:292-320` (the closed-env sanctioned list — the two
  new depth keys), `subagent_box_test.rb:301` (`assert_equal nil, status["task"]`).
  No pin OUTSIDE the touch set contradicts the laws (audited: health fixtures
  fabricate LEGACY task-null dirs — correct post-change too, adoption tolerance;
  `tools_test.rb:114` pins the raise for `rm_rf` — still unknown post-change;
  intercom/health `spawn_argv_and_env` pins assert PI_MODEL/PI_PROVIDER only —
  additive keys survive; the e2e `sessions/**/*.jsonl` globs match both layouts).
- Live specimens on disk (read-only evidence): the doubled-path run dir +
  task-null status above; the 07:40Z transcript (the rejection debugging).

## Open questions (ruled at spec time; none deferred)

- **OQ-1 (plan's own OQ) — pi-parity grants + recursion bound: RULED.** Grant =
  the tools list (pi `child-tool-plan.js:200-204`; the playbooks list `subagent`
  explicitly). Bound = pi's depth law verbatim: default 2, env override, child
  inherits, blocked raise carries pi's bytes. `allowNestedSubagents` stays
  tolerated-and-ignored (declared residual — a pi playbook relying on it ALONE
  would not gain nesting in tart; no known playbook does).
- **OQ-2 — warn surface: RULED.** The diagnostic is unit-pinned in
  `Profiles.discover`'s Result (the Skills::Diagnostic shape), AND the
  interactive boot renders one `command_line` row per profile diagnostic
  (the `bin/tart:556-559` idiom) — this also makes today's DARK malformed-file
  warnings visible (declared behavior change, same channel, same idiom). Print
  children have no boot surface — the drop itself is pinned on the child wire.
- **OQ-3 — all-unknown tools list: RULED.** Loads with ZERO tools + the warning
  (an explicit empty list is meaningful — pi's loadout makes it so; the
  builtin-seven default applies ONLY to an omitted/nil tools line, unchanged).

## Specification

# Specification — I81 `agent-loading-forensics` (ONE lane, repo tart)

## Objective

Close the plan's ENTRY 6 (the successor plan's LAST entry): make tart host the
full loop — custom agents that name tools tart doesn't know LOAD with a warning
(pi's behavior), the `subagent` tool becomes grantable so a custom agent can
spawn children (the coordinator role becomes hostable), and a post-mortem can
answer "what was this run asked to do" from disk alone. Three laws, all frozen
below; the standing battery (92 gates) is the floor. Cites:
`notes/plan-20261018T1745Z-live-run-successor.md` ENTRY 6; BRIEF §8 (the
exact-parity bar); the Grounds section above (mechanisms, pi cites, live
specimens, the carried-pin audit).

## Law 1 — the agent-loading law (warn-and-drop)

A custom agent profile whose `tools` frontmatter names tools outside the known
universe LOADS: the spec's `tools` = the known entries in DECLARATION order, and
discovery emits exactly ONE warning diagnostic for the file. Only a structurally
invalid `tools` value (not a comma-string, not an array of strings) still
warn+skips the file — today's behavior, byte-unchanged
(`schemas/subagents.rb` shape rule; pi `agents.js:739-741` throws on shape only).

- **The universe grows `subagent`**: `ProfileFields::TOOLS_UNIVERSE` =
  `%w[read edit write bash find grep ls contact_supervisor subagent]`. The
  known-set is the ONE closed list this law widens; nothing else becomes
  grantable through the contract (`rm_rf` etc. stay unknown — the
  `tools_test.rb:114` pin survives untouched).
- **The drop happens at profile build** (`profiles.rb`): the contract's tools
  rule validates SHAPE only; `build_profile`/`tools_list` filters unknown
  names out of the spec and returns them for the diagnostic. An
  omitted/nil `tools` line still means the builtin seven (`tools_list`'s nil
  arm, unchanged); an explicit list that drops to EMPTY means ZERO tools plus
  the warning (OQ-3 ruling).
- **The diagnostic** (port-own vocabulary — pi has no warn analog; continuity
  with the retired reject message): ONE per affected file,
  `Skills::Diagnostic.new(type: "warning", path: <file>)` with message
  EXACTLY `unknown tool(s) <names> — dropped (valid tools: <universe sorted,
  comma+space>)` where `<names>` is the dropped entries in declaration order,
  comma+space joined. A file with zero dropped names emits nothing.
- **The surface** (OQ-2 ruling): the interactive boot renders one
  `surface.command_line("#{d.path}: #{d.message}")` row per profile diagnostic,
  the `bin/tart:556-559` skills/prompts idiom, inside the gate-on subagents
  branch (a fresh `Profiles.discover` call — resolution stays per-spawn and
  uncached; the boot call is a read-only extra scan). Malformed-file warnings
  become visible through the same row — declared. NO MOTD change (the I70 tier
  law); no print-boot surface.
- The unknown-agent error, the model ladder, the bridge union, the
  frontmatter-name/thinking/context rules: byte-unchanged.

## Law 2 — the nested-grant law (`subagent` grantable, depth-bounded)

A custom agent declaring `subagent` in `tools` can spawn children, to pi's
depth bar.

- **Contract**: covered by Law 1's universe widening (the name is known).
- **Registry** (`tools/registry.rb`): `Tools::Registry.build`'s selected-list
  validation ACCEPTS the name `subagent` (a named constant beside
  `TOOL_CLASSES` — e.g. the selectable vocabulary — so the acceptance is
  pinnable); the registry NEVER builds it (no `TOOL_CLASSES` entry, no
  constructor); the hooks registered-tools merge (unchanged, `registry.rb:80-86`)
  supplies the instance and keeps it LAST on the wire (the I47 merge order). A
  selected `subagent` that no registered tool supplies (a gate-off child —
  near-unreachable: a `subagents: false` settings row disables the parent's own
  tool first) drops from the loadout silently — pi's loadout parity
  (`agent-session.ts:1575-1582`); declared, pinned as a no-raise unit.
- **The child argv**: unchanged shape — `--tools` carries the spec's tools
  (now possibly including `subagent`) + the bridge-unioned
  `contact_supervisor` tail (I49 D5, byte-pinned for builtins; a custom
  agent's list keeps ITS declaration order with the union tail).
- **The depth law** (pi-subagents 0.79.1 verbatim semantics,
  `shared/types.js:134-201`): the shared constants + normalize/check helpers
  land in `lib/tart/subagents.rb` (the module shared-types home — the pi
  `types.js` analog): `DEFAULT_MAX_SUBAGENT_DEPTH = 2`; a session's own depth
  = `<IDENTITY>_SUBAGENTS_DEPTH` env (non-negative integer; absent/invalid →
  0 at the top level); a session's max = `<IDENTITY>_SUBAGENTS_MAX_DEPTH` env
  (non-negative integer; absent/invalid → the default 2). The Manager reads
  both at construction from its `env:` (the existing `@env`/`@identity`
  pair). `spawn_run` checks FIRST (before any disk resolution): own
  `depth >= max` → raise `ArgumentError` with pi's spawn-side bytes EXACTLY
  (`subagent-executor.js:6983-6993`):
  `Nested subagent call blocked (depth=<d>, max=<m>). You are running at the
  maximum subagent nesting depth. Complete your current task directly without
  delegating to further subagents.`
  — riding the existing raise→`{error:}` tool-result path (the unknown-agent
  precedent). Every spawn writes the child env picks
  `<IDENTITY>_SUBAGENTS_DEPTH = <own depth + 1>` and
  `<IDENTITY>_SUBAGENTS_MAX_DEPTH = <own max>` (always, both keys — the closed
  pick list grows EXACTLY these two; nil-key omission rules untouched).
- **`allowNestedSubagents`** frontmatter: stays tolerated-and-ignored (OQ-1
  ruling; declared residual — pi `child-tool-plan.js:200-204` also authorizes
  via it, no known playbook relies on it alone).

## Law 3 — the forensics law (transcript path + the task on disk)

- **Transcript path, single `sessions`**: the child argv's `--session-root`
  value becomes the run dir itself (`run[:dir]`, `manager.rb:398`), so the
  Recorder's composition (`agent/session.rb:78-80`, UNTOUCHED — hard-frozen)
  lands the transcript at `<run-dir>/sessions/<cwd-slug>/<ts>_<id>.jsonl`.
  `status.sessionRoot` keeps its value `File.join(dir, "sessions")` — now the
  ACCURATE container of the transcript. The `--session-root` help text and
  the Recorder/session seams: byte-unchanged. Historical doubled dirs: the
  manager's transcript glob (`manager.rb:1225`, unchanged shape) matches both
  layouts — legacy adoption tolerance is PINNED.
- **The task on disk**: `status.task` carries the spawn's task argument
  VERBATIM (the RAW string — the fork preamble is harness boilerplate and is
  excluded; `taskChars` stays the raw task's CHARACTER count, unchanged).
  The write is the existing atomic `write_status` flip — the field stops
  being null, nothing else in the payload moves (key order, the additive
  box fields, the legacy nil-tolerance all unchanged). Readers that never
  rendered a task (the I79 box, `render/subagent_box.rb:27-28`) stay
  byte-unchanged; legacy `task: null` dirs stay tolerated (the I78 health
  fixtures prove it cold).

## Output format

- The lane's pins land in the four declared test files (no new files — all
  touch paths exist at base). Minimum frozen counts: profiles `/dropped/`
  ≥ 2; subagents `/nested|depth_cap/` ≥ 3; subagents `/forensic/` ≥ 2; e2e
  `/nested/` ≥ 1; the full-file floors 15/34 (profiles/subagents) hold GREEN.
- Report tables: per-gate RED/GREEN with the rehearsal vector, the suite
  run/assert counts at the lane tree, the e2e leg's captured wire facts
  (child wire declares `subagent`; grandchild run dir + result), the
  depth-blocked error bytes, the forensic path/task assertions.
- Verification scratch: `t81*` out dirs (never committed); lane report at
  `build/I81-agent-loading-forensics-core/report.md`.

## Tool guidance (exact, measured this session)

- Base floor (repos/tart @ `7b70e8a`, cold, this session):
  `bundle install --quiet && bundle exec rake` → 1453 runs / 6846 asserts /
  0F / 0E / 1S, exit 0; `bundle exec ruby bench/seam_bench.rb` →
  `SEAM_BENCH_OK`. Floors pin RUN counts (the assert counter is the
  I78-verdict dynamic class).
- Rehearsal: `architect rehearse agent-loading-forensics` (fresh stamp before
  freeze — never `--skip-rehearse`).
- Rig execs: `env -u HERDR_ENV -u HERDR_TAB_ID -u HERDR_SOCKET_PATH -u
  HERDR_BIN_PATH -u HERDR_WORKSPACE_ID -u HERDR_PANE_ID` (the standing
  prefix); judge runs gates at the LANE tree; never gates under nohup.
- Parity oracles: pi-subagents 0.79.1 at
  `~/.pi/agent/npm/node_modules/pi-subagents/src/` (the subagents seams);
  `repos/pi` @ v1.1.0 (the rig oracle); the live specimens
  `~/.tart/subagents/01a14df7-f99a-7244-a23e-e172ebd97383/` (doubled path +
  task null) and the 07:40Z devstral transcript (the rejections) — READ-ONLY.

## Boundaries

- **May touch (the frozen 10-path set — all exist at base, no new files)**:
  `lib/tart/schemas/subagents.rb`, `lib/tart/subagents/profiles.rb`,
  `lib/tart/subagents/manager.rb`, `lib/tart/subagents.rb`,
  `lib/tart/tools/registry.rb`, `bin/tart`,
  `test/subagents_profiles_test.rb`, `test/subagents_test.rb`,
  `test/subagents_e2e_test.rb`, `test/subagent_box_test.rb`.
- **Must not touch (hard-frozen)**: `lib/tart/agent/session.rb` (the
  `<root>/sessions/<slug>` layout law — the doubled-path cure is
  manager-argv-side ONLY); `lib/tart/child_env.rb` (the I73 scrub law);
  `lib/tart/render/**` (the I70 MOTD tier law + the I79 box law); the rig
  (`gems/**` — no scenario-content edits, the plan constraint); `Gemfile`,
  `Gemfile.lock`, `tart.gemspec`, `bench/**`; every other file under `lib/`
  and `test/`. No new gems. No wire or session-golden movement (the child
  wire changes ONLY where a declared-`subagent` agent spawns — the parity
  scenarios never do).
- **Out of scope**: per-agent `maxSubagentDepth` frontmatter (pi
  `launch-contract.js:69`; tolerated-ignored like `allowNestedSubagents`);
  any intercom/workflow-template change; the parked devstral-docs trial
  (owner ruling); richer `first_error_line` classification (the I80 digest's
  backlog note — owner backlog, not this lane).

## Lane plan

ONE lane — three laws over the profile/manager/registry seams, both-ways pins,
the standing 92-gate battery.

```lanes
- name: core
  repo: tart
  touch:
    - lib/tart/schemas/subagents.rb
    - lib/tart/subagents/profiles.rb
    - lib/tart/subagents/manager.rb
    - lib/tart/subagents.rb
    - lib/tart/tools/registry.rb
    - bin/tart
    - test/subagents_profiles_test.rb
    - test/subagents_test.rb
    - test/subagents_e2e_test.rb
    - test/subagent_box_test.rb
  effort: medium
```

## Effort call

`medium` — a bounded, fully-specified mechanism (all three laws frozen with
pi-cited reference behavior; every contradicting carried pin enumerated as a
declared re-pin BEFORE freeze; no perf exposure, no parity-scenario exposure),
but it owes the new unit batteries (≥ 7 new pinned tests across three filters),
a real-subprocess NESTED e2e leg (three process generations against the mock
endpoint), the boot-surface seam in `bin/tart`, and the full 92-gate standing
battery.

## Acceptance Criteria

Property-level, each independently judgeable. The frozen ```gates block
below is the machine-checkable form: **92 gates — 4 new (this iteration's
discriminators) + 1 rewritten (`scope`, rewritten per-iteration) + 87 carried
from the I80 block with the standing rebases** (the I80 digest's carry
instruction): the `t81*` out-dir era prefix (the standing `t75*`–`t80*`
families in the MAIN checkout are judge/rehearsal scratch, never committed),
the diff bases `34ba69af`→`7b70e8a`, and the scope gate REWRITTEN to this
iteration's frozen 10-path touch set. Carried gates keep their origin `ac:`
labels verbatim (their adjudication history travels with them — the AC6-labeled
members are historical anchors from the iterations that owned them); every
carried member is a regression anchor for landed behavior (I69–I80 products
are baseline). Carry audit ran clean BEFORE rehearsal
(`tmp/i81-spec/`: the extracted I80 block vs this one — 87 carried
byte-identical after the declared rebases, 1 declared drop (`scope`,
rewritten per-iteration), 4 new, zero duplicate ids, all 92 well-formed
YAML).

**The carried-pin audit (the I80 lesson — closed-env/closed-list pins and
must-differ legs checked against the frozen touch set BEFORE freeze):** the
I81 laws contradict exactly FIVE carried pins, every one INSIDE the frozen
touch set as a DECLARED re-pin — `test/subagents_profiles_test.rb:129-134`
(the unknown-tool reject message → the warn-and-drop diagnostic),
`test/subagents_test.rb:257` (task never recorded → task verbatim),
`:290` (the session-root argv value `<dir>/sessions` → `<dir>`),
`:292-320` (the closed-env sanctioned list → gains exactly
`PI_SUBAGENTS_DEPTH PI_SUBAGENTS_MAX_DEPTH`), `test/subagent_box_test.rb:301`
(`assert_equal nil, status["task"]` → the raw text). Audited clean OUTSIDE
the set: health fixtures fabricate LEGACY task-null dirs (correct
post-change — adoption tolerance), `tools_test.rb:114` pins `rm_rf` still
unknown, intercom/health argv pins assert model keys only (additive keys
survive), the e2e transcript globs match both layouts. All ten touch paths
EXIST at base — every must-differ leg is a tracked-file diff, no `[ -f ]`
legs.

**AC1 (the agent-loading law).** A custom agent whose `tools` frontmatter
names unknown tools (the live coordinator/builder shapes) LOADS: the resolved
spec's `tools` = the known entries in declaration order; discovery emits
exactly ONE warning diagnostic for the file, message `unknown tool(s) <names>
— dropped (valid tools: <universe sorted>)`; an all-unknown list loads with
ZERO tools plus the diagnostic; a structurally invalid `tools` value still
warn+skips the file (today's bytes); `subagent` is a known name; an
omitted `tools` line still means the builtin seven. The interactive boot
renders one `command_line` row per profile diagnostic (the skills/prompts
idiom — the bin/tart seam is letter-pinned: the launcher smoke gate protects
the boot; the diagnostic content is unit-pinned). Gates:
`agent-loading-units` (+ the carried MOTD/box anchors prove nothing else
moved).

**AC2 (the nested-grant law).** A custom agent declaring `subagent` loads,
its child argv `--tools` carries the name (declaration order +
`contact_supervisor` tail), `Tools::Registry.build` accepts the name without
building it and without raising (a `subagent` selection with no registered
instance drops silently — pi loadout parity, pinned as a no-raise unit), and
NESTED SPAWNING WORKS END TO END: a real parent print subprocess whose model
calls `subagent` on a CUSTOM agent (declared in the staged agents dir, its
`tools` including `subagent` and at least one unknown entry — exercising
AC1 on the same leg) spawns the child, the child's wire declares `subagent`
(LAST, the merge order), the child's model spawns a grandchild, the
grandchild's output rides back through the chain, and the grandchild's run
dir + result land under the staged home. The depth law: default max 2
(pi `DEFAULT_SUBAGENT_DEPTH` semantics); `<IDENTITY>_SUBAGENTS_MAX_DEPTH`
env override (non-negative integer, invalid ignored); the child env carries
exactly `DEPTH = own+1` and `MAX_DEPTH = own max` (the closed list grows
exactly those two keys); a session at `depth >= max` cannot spawn — the
raise carries pi's blocked bytes VERBATIM through the `{error:}` tool-result
path. Gates: `nested-grant-units` + `agent-loading-e2e`.

**AC3 (the forensics law).** A spawned run's transcript lands with exactly
ONE `sessions` path segment — `<run-dir>/sessions/<cwd-slug>/<ts>_<id>.jsonl`
— and `status.sessionRoot` equals the transcript's containing dir (the
run's `sessions/` itself); `status.task` equals the spawn's task argument
BYTE-VERBATIM (raw, fork preamble excluded) with `taskChars` the raw
character count; the box renders no task row (unchanged); a LEGACY
doubled-path dir and a LEGACY `task: null` status still adopt without
raising. The post-mortem property: from `status.json` ALONE one reads the
task text and the transcript location — "what was this run asked to do" is
answerable from disk. Gates: `forensics-units` + `agent-loading-e2e` (the
nested leg's artifacts carry the assertions live).

**AC4 (the full floor holds).** At the lane tree: the suite is strictly
greater than the base floor (**1453 runs / 6846 asserts / 0F / 0E / 1S at
`7b70e8a`, measured cold this session; floors pin run counts — the assert
counter is the I78-verdict dynamic class**) with `SEAM_BENCH_OK`; every
carried gate holds — wire-delta + session-golden EXACT, the pty battery,
the oracle family, the markdown battery, the child-env/encoding family, the
session-sink family, the signal-hygiene family, the box/probe family, the
I77–I80 anchors. Gates: `suite`, `bench` + all 87 carried members.

**AC5 (scope).** The lane's diff bites EXACTLY the frozen 10-path touch set
(every path exists at base — tracked-file must-differ legs, none empty);
`lib/tart/agent/session.rb`, `lib/tart/child_env.rb`, `lib/tart/render/**`,
the rig, and the packaging files are hard-frozen (zero diff); the `t81*`
rehearsal/judge scratch and the standing `t75*`–`t80*` families are
tolerated untracked, never committed. Gates: `scope`.

**Rehearsal declaration — MEASURED (fresh stamp, never --skip-rehearse).**
**GREEN 87 / RED 5 / BROKEN 0 / EMPTY 0** at base tip `7b70e8a`
(`build/rehearse/I81-agent-loading-forensics-20261019T003021.194263.md`):
the five RED are each verified for EXACTLY its declared reason —
`agent-loading-units` leg 2 ("FAIL warn-and-drop pins runs=0 … filter
empty, declared-new"), `nested-grant-units` leg 2 ("FAIL nested-grant
pins runs=0 …"), `forensics-units` ("FAIL forensics pins runs=0 …"),
`agent-loading-e2e` ("FAIL nested e2e runs=0 …") — all four the
empty-filter runs=0 shape — plus `scope` RED on the EMPTY must-differ
legs at base (the standing I77–I80 class; the leak-check legs exit 0
clean, both hard-freeze packaging/render legs quiet, judge-verified
leg-by-leg this session). All 87 carried GREEN cold this run — incl.
`render-perf-probe`, `s9-parity` + `herdr-wire-probe` at canonical depth,
suite, wire-delta, session-golden EXACT.

## Builder Prompt

### core

# Builder lane prompt — iteration `agent-loading-forensics` (I81), lane `core`, repo `tart`

You are the builder for iteration `agent-loading-forensics` (I81), lane `core`, repo `tart`. You are the ONLY lane. Your worktree is `build/I81-agent-loading-forensics-core/wt` (base `7b70e8a`, branch `lane/I81-agent-loading-forensics-core`) — do all work THERE; the space's main checkout is read-only for you. **ZERO live API calls of any kind** — no provider keys, no driver scripts, no spend (every pin and leg is hermetic: staged homes, the MockLLMServer, closed subprocess envs).

## THE CONTRACT — read it first, in full

The authoritative, FROZEN contract is `architecture/I81-agent-loading-forensics.md` in the space repo: its **Grounds**, **Specification**, and **Acceptance Criteria** sections (the three Laws, Output format, Tool guidance, Boundaries, Lane plan, the 92-gate frozen ```gates block with its rehearsal declarations). READ THE WHOLE FILE before doing anything. Where this header and the arch file differ, THE ARCH FILE WINS.

Supporting read: `notes/spec-digest-20261019T035116Z-child-encoding-hygiene.md` (the I80 handoff — the carry/adjudication classes, the declared-RED pattern, judge-runs-gates-at-the-lane-tree, never gates under nohup, short out dirs, the closed-env re-pin precedent) and this spec's scratch `tmp/i81-spec/` (grounds/spec/AC sources + the carried-gates rebase — READ-ONLY reference; never copy into the repo).

## THE DEFECTS (three, all root-caused at base with live specimens)

(a) A custom agent whose `tools` frontmatter names a tool tart doesn't know is REJECTED outright — the coordinator/builder playbooks (`bg_wait`, `web_search`, `fetch_content`, `get_search_content`) never loaded; the only surface was `unknown agent "architect-coordinator"`. Mechanism: `schemas/subagents.rb` `rule(:tools)` fails the WHOLE contract on any name outside `TOOLS_UNIVERSE` → `profiles.rb` warn+skips the file. pi (the parity bar) never validates NAMES at load (shape only — `agents.js:739-741`); unknown names drop at loadout (`agent-session.ts:1575-1582`). (b) `subagent` is ungrantable: `TOOLS_UNIVERSE` omits it, and `Tools::Registry.build` raises `Unknown tool: subagent` (`registry.rb:66-69`) — so the coordinator role is unhostable; there is ALSO no recursion bound anywhere. (c) Forensics: the transcript path doubles (`<run-dir>/sessions/sessions/<slug>/…` — the argv passes `--session-root <dir>/sessions` while `session.rb:78-80` joins `sessions` again; live specimen `~/.tart/subagents/01a14df7-f99a-7244-a23e-e172ebd97383/`), and `status.json` carries `"task": null` with only `taskChars` populated (same specimen).

## WHAT YOU ARE LANDING (three frozen laws, one lane)

1. **LAW 1 — the agent-loading law (warn-and-drop)** (`lib/tart/schemas/subagents.rb` + `lib/tart/subagents/profiles.rb` + one `bin/tart` line): the contract's tools rule validates SHAPE ONLY (non-array/non-strings still fails → warn+skip, today's bytes); `TOOLS_UNIVERSE` gains `subagent` (exactly that one widening — `rm_rf` etc. stay unknown, the `tools_test.rb:114` pin survives); `build_profile`/`tools_list` DROP unknown names from the spec (known entries keep declaration order; nil line still = builtin seven; an explicit list dropping to EMPTY = zero tools) and emit exactly ONE warning diagnostic per affected file: `Skills::Diagnostic.new(type: "warning", path: <file>)`, message EXACTLY `unknown tool(s) <names> — dropped (valid tools: <universe sorted, comma+space>)` with `<names>` the dropped entries in declaration order, comma+space joined. The interactive boot renders one `surface.command_line("#{d.path}: #{d.message}")` row per profile diagnostic — the `bin/tart:556-559` skills/prompts idiom, inside the gate-on subagents branch (a fresh read-only `Profiles.discover`; per-spawn resolution stays uncached). NO MOTD change; no print-boot surface.
2. **LAW 2 — the nested-grant law** (`lib/tart/tools/registry.rb` + `lib/tart/subagents.rb` + `lib/tart/subagents/manager.rb`): `Registry.build`'s selected-list validation ACCEPTS the name `subagent` via a named constant beside `TOOL_CLASSES` (pinnable); it NEVER builds it — the hooks registered-tools merge (unchanged) supplies the instance, LAST on the wire; a `subagent` selection with no registered instance drops silently (pi loadout parity — pinned as a no-raise unit). The depth law (pi-subagents 0.79.1 `shared/types.js:134-201` verbatim semantics): shared constants + normalize/check helpers land in `lib/tart/subagents.rb` — `DEFAULT_MAX_SUBAGENT_DEPTH = 2`; own depth = `<IDENTITY>_SUBAGENTS_DEPTH` (non-negative integer, absent/invalid → 0); own max = `<IDENTITY>_SUBAGENTS_MAX_DEPTH` (non-negative integer, absent/invalid → 2); the Manager reads both at construction from its `env:`; `spawn_run` checks FIRST — own `depth >= max` → raise `ArgumentError` with pi's bytes EXACTLY (`subagent-executor.js:6983-6993`): `Nested subagent call blocked (depth=<d>, max=<m>). You are running at the maximum subagent nesting depth. Complete your current task directly without delegating to further subagents.` — riding the existing raise→`{error:}` path. Every spawn writes BOTH child env picks `<IDENTITY>_SUBAGENTS_DEPTH = own+1` and `<IDENTITY>_SUBAGENTS_MAX_DEPTH = own max` (always; the closed pick list grows EXACTLY these two keys). `allowNestedSubagents` frontmatter stays tolerated-and-ignored (declared residual).
3. **LAW 3 — the forensics law** (`lib/tart/subagents/manager.rb` only): the child argv `--session-root` value becomes `run[:dir]` (one line, :398) so the transcript lands `<run-dir>/sessions/<cwd-slug>/<ts>_<id>.jsonl` — `lib/tart/agent/session.rb` is HARD-FROZEN byte-untouched (the doubled-path cure is argv-side ONLY); `status.sessionRoot` keeps `File.join(dir, "sessions")` (now the accurate container; the manager's `sessions/**/*.jsonl` glob at :1225 matches BOTH layouts — legacy doubled dirs keep adopting). `status.task` carries the spawn's RAW task argument VERBATIM (fork preamble excluded; `taskChars` stays the raw CHARACTER count; nothing else in the payload moves — key order, additive box fields, legacy nil-tolerance unchanged); the I79 box never renders a task row (byte-unchanged).

Frozen discipline you must not drift from: wire-delta + session-golden hold EXACT (the child wire changes ONLY where a declared-`subagent` agent spawns — the parity scenarios never do); no rig scenario-content edits; no new gems; no new `Thread.new` sites; the I73 scrub law and `lib/tart/child_env.rb` byte-untouched; `lib/tart/render/**` byte-untouched (I70 MOTD tier + I79 box laws).

## THE DECLARED RE-PINS (the I80 lesson — these five carried pins contradict the laws; every one is IN your touch set)

`test/subagents_profiles_test.rb:129-134` (the unknown-tool reject message → the warn-and-drop diagnostic + universe-with-subagent listing); `test/subagents_test.rb:257` (task never recorded → task verbatim); `:290` (session-root argv `<dir>/sessions` → `<dir>`); `:292-320` (the closed-env sanctioned list gains exactly `PI_SUBAGENTS_DEPTH PI_SUBAGENTS_MAX_DEPTH` — keep the I80 LANG/LC_ALL/LC_CTYPE entries and the standing comment discipline, extend it with this law's note); `test/subagent_box_test.rb:301` (`assert_equal nil, status["task"]` → the raw text; the write_status FIXTURE's `"task" => nil` STAYS — it fabricates legacy adopted dirs, correct post-change). Everything else you re-pin only behavior-preserving.

## Deliverable (frozen Output format)

Code + tests, exactly the 10-path touch set. Minimum pin floors (all filters verified EMPTY at base — the four new gates are declared-RED there): `test/subagents_profiles_test.rb` `/dropped/` ≥ 2 (warn-and-drop keeps known entries in order; all-unknown → zero tools + diagnostic) and the full file GREEN ≥ 15 runs; `test/subagents_test.rb` `/nested|depth_cap/` ≥ 3 (registry accepts `subagent` without building/raising; the depth env picks land in `spawn_argv_and_env`; a depth-capped Manager raises pi's blocked bytes verbatim) and the full file GREEN ≥ 34 runs; `test/subagents_test.rb` `/forensic/` ≥ 2 (single-`sessions` transcript path + `sessionRoot` = its container + `status.task` byte-verbatim + `taskChars` consistency; a LEGACY doubled-path dir + task:null status adopt without raising); `test/subagents_e2e_test.rb` `/nested/` ≥ 1 — ONE new nested e2e leg on the leg-A machinery (staged HOME + agents dir, MockLLMServer, real `bin/tart -p` subprocesses): the parent's model calls `subagent` on a CUSTOM agent whose `tools:` include `subagent` AND an unknown entry (the drop asserted on the child's captured wire — `subagent` declared LAST, the unknown name absent), the child spawns a grandchild whose output rides back, the grandchild's run dir + result land under the staged home, and the leg carries the Law-3 assertions live (transcript single-`sessions`, status task text). Any edit to existing legs is behavior-preserving re-pinning only.

## Operating constraints (lane)

- Touch set (frozen, the scope gate bites exactly, ALL paths exist at base — no new files): `lib/tart/schemas/subagents.rb`, `lib/tart/subagents/profiles.rb`, `lib/tart/subagents/manager.rb`, `lib/tart/subagents.rb`, `lib/tart/tools/registry.rb`, `bin/tart`, `test/subagents_profiles_test.rb`, `test/subagents_test.rb`, `test/subagents_e2e_test.rb`, `test/subagent_box_test.rb` — all ten must-differ seams must change. HARD-FROZEN: `lib/tart/agent/session.rb`, `lib/tart/child_env.rb`, `lib/tart/render/**`, `gems/**`, `Gemfile`, `Gemfile.lock`, `tart.gemspec`, `bench/**`.
- No live API spend. No new gems. No new threads. No rig scenario edits.
- PHASE 0: every disagreement with this spec is raised with reasons in your report (or an explicit statement of what was checked before concluding the spec is sound) — silent compliance is a defect.
- The five declared-RED gates (`agent-loading-units` leg 2, `nested-grant-units` leg 2, `forensics-units`, `agent-loading-e2e`, `scope` — scope REDs on the empty must-differ legs pre-work) turn GREEN only with your lane work; everything else is a regression anchor that must not move. The standing adjudication classes (s9/herdr lane-tree depth, render-perf BP2 load margin, the suite's env/interrupt classes) are declared in the AC — never silently patched.
- Scratch under `build/I81-agent-loading-forensics-core/scratch/`; never commit the `t81*` gate out dirs.
- Verification (exact, measured at base this session): `bundle install --quiet && bundle exec rake` → 1453 runs / 6846 asserts / 0F / 0E / 1S, exit 0 (post-lane ≥ 1453 runs, 0F/0E); `bundle exec ruby bench/seam_bench.rb 2>&1 | tail -1` → `SEAM_BENCH_OK`.
- Report at `build/I81-agent-loading-forensics-core/report.md`: the suite summary line, the FULL 92-gate table (every gate, one measured one-liner each — itemize-and-defend), deviations itemized, a final `STATUS:` line.

- **Acceptance Criteria integrity** — frozen sections unchanged since freeze (`architect verify agent-loading-forensics`)?

| AC# | Raw result | Brief § | Verdict |
|-----|------------|---------|---------|
|     |            |         | PASS/FAIL/INVALID |

- **Iteration** — KILL / CONTINUE + the single decisive reason (e.g. "diff vs BRIEF §1/§3.3 faithful — CONTINUE").
